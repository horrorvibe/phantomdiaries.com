  <h2>True Horror Story from Texas</h2>
  <p>
    In a remote town in Texas, an abandoned farmhouse became the center of unexplainable fear.
    Neighbors reported hearing footsteps echoing through empty halls, whispers in the dead of night,
    and doors opening on their own. A family who dared to stay overnight fled before sunrise,
    claiming something was watching them from the shadows.
  </p>

  <h2>Haunted House in New Orleans</h2>
  <p>
    New Orleans is known for its dark history, but one house on the outskirts of the city is feared even today.
    Visitors describe sudden drops in temperature, voices calling their names, and the feeling of unseen hands
    brushing against them. Paranormal investigators believe the spirits there are restless and aware.
  </p>

  <h2>Paranormal Encounter in California</h2>
  <p>
    Late one night, a truck driver traveling through rural California reported seeing a pale human-like figure
    standing motionless in the middle of the road. When he stopped his vehicle, the figure vanished instantly,
    leaving behind an unnatural silence and an overwhelming sense of dread.
  </p>

  <h2>Urban Legend from Appalachia</h2>
  <p>
    Deep within the Appalachian mountains, locals whisper about a presence that mimics human voices.
    Campers have gone missing after following cries for help that lead deep into the forest.
    Those who return speak of glowing eyes watching from between the trees.
